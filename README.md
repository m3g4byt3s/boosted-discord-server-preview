# Discord Boost Preview

I wanted a way to see what a boosted Discord server would look like, so I made this site!  
It lets you switch between boost levels (0–3) and preview features like server banners, vanity URLs, and other perks.

## 🔹 Features
- Fake server preview with icon, name, banner, and vanity URL
- Toggle buttons for Level 0, Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3
- Simple design inspired by Discord’s layout
- Easy to customize with your own server images

## 🚀 Live Demo
